  <p> My original goal was to create something but challenging at the same time. With that in mind, I decided to create a game that allowed for the user to control a delayed character with a delayed obstacle as well. To keep the game cute and child-friendly, I decided to make it underwater themed! You initially begin by choosing a character, a blowfish for easy and a magikarp for harder difficulty. The difficulty is in the max speed as well as the acceleration of the character to give the player more or less control over the fishes. </p>

  <p> This image was the use of human touch to simulate the left and right paddles of the paddle in the game of pong</p>

  <p> We get a bit closer to an actual controller using play doh. Play Doh has conductivity which allows us to pass a current through to the makey controller! </p>

  <p> Next up we use graphite to create a physical controller by paper. We had to ensure that we made the graphite extremely dark so that the touches would register accordingly. We still had to use a bracelet in order to pass through a current</p>

  <p> Using graphite again, we made piano keys so that it is easier for the user to match the keys to that of the game</p>

  <p> Finally, we decided to implement our own physical controller. What the previous controllers did not have was the handheld compatibility. We used two sticks to hold everything together and aluminum as buttons.</p>
   <img src="img12.jpg" alt="game" height="500" width="600">
  <p> We made an update to the controller to remove the need of the bracelet. We added aluminum to the back so that our back fingers touched the part passing current and so we were able to use a physical controller without the need of a bracelet! </p>
